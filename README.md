# ProTune

By Aneesh Ashutosh and Tim Pornyuenyong.

## Description

ProTune is a music tuning app developed by Aneesh Ashutosh and Tim Pornyuenyong as their final project for iOS Programming at NYU. The app was designed for musicians of all levels; as such, we have included three main features.

1) The tuner. The core of our app. This feature is aimed at musicians of all levels. Play a note into the phone and it will tell you what it hears, and you can adjust accordingly. 

2) The instrument adjustment guide. It's good to know that you need to tune your instrument; but how do you go about it? We included a reference guide for several instruments which explains, in easy-to-follow steps, how to go about tuning your instrument. This feature is aimed at beginner musicians. The way we implemented it also makes it extremely easy to update to support new instruments.

3) The ear trainer. This view helps musicians get better pitch. The app will play two separate notes, and allow the user to select what interval that they think they heard. Additionally, we understand that most musicians are children; so we introduced a score mechanic to help them stick with it. By practicing with ProTune, anyone can acquire a better pitch.

## Requirements

XCode

Swift 4.2

CocoaPods

## Installation
`pod install` to install dependencies. There have been some issues with some configurations (during development, when Tim used `pod install`, the pods would not install correctly), so we have included the pods in our submission.
